# Functionality

The functionality of a todo list application can vary depending on your specific requirements and desired features. However, here are some common functionalities you can consider implementing in your todo list application:

[x] Task Creation: Allow users to create new tasks by providing an input field where they can enter the task name and press a button or hit enter to add it to the list.

[x] Task Display: Show the list of tasks with their relevant details, such as task name, due date, priority, or any other attributes you want to include:
  [x] Task name
  [x] Due date
  [x] Priority

[x] Task Editing: Enable users to edit existing tasks by providing an option to update the task name, due date, or any other properties associated with the task.

[x] Task Deletion: Allow users to delete tasks from the list when they are completed or no longer relevant.

[x] Task Completion: Provide an option to mark tasks as completed or mark them with a checkmark when the user finishes them.

[ ] Task Filtering: Implement filters to allow users to view specific subsets of tasks, such as all tasks, completed tasks, or incomplete tasks. You can also provide filtering options based on priority or due date.

[ ] Task Sorting: Allow users to sort the tasks based on different criteria, such as due date, priority, or alphabetical order.

[ ] Task Persistence: Implement functionality to save tasks so that users can access them even after closing or refreshing the application. This can be achieved using local storage or integrating with a backend server for data persistence.

[ ] Task Reminders: If desired, you can add a feature to set reminders or notifications for tasks that have due dates, ensuring that users are alerted before their tasks are overdue.

Remember to create a clean and intuitive user interface, with smooth interactions and error handling for a seamless user experience.
